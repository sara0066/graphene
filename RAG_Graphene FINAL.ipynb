The graphene is then transferred onto the substrate using the standard wet transfer method. The flow of the fabrication process for the double-layer graphene stack is shown in Supplementary Fig. 10. The method of producing graphene involves depositing 72 nm of graphene on a substrate using a thermal evaporator and then transferring it onto the substrate using a semi-dry transfer method. The yield of graphene produced using this method is estimated by weighting the dried graphene powders and the dried sediment. The yield of graphene produced using this method is about 15%. The paper by Liu et al. (2018) presents a systematic study to explore the fundamental factors that affect the yield of graphene produced using this method. The paper by Juang et al.

The Ni foil (30 µm in thickness) was used as the substrate and the detailed description of the experimental procedure for GO synthesis is given in the Supplementary data. The current experimental setup can produce ca. 17 g of GO using 12 g of natural flake graphite with full coverage by atmospheric pressure CVD implemented in a vacuum-free outfit. The absence of FLG patches is related to the absence of decomposition of methane on the backside microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD). The plasma/metal interaction can be advantageous for a rapid synthesis of such thin films.

      "The facile liquid phase exfoliation method has been tested and tried with amounts of materials, specifically with graphite flakes. The method involves pre-treating the graphite foil with liquid nitrogen and absolute ethanol, and then mixing it with a 9:1 mixture of concentrated H2SO4/H3PO4 and 18 g of KMnO4. The mixture is stirred mechanically at 35-40 C for 4e5 h. The resulting exfoliated graphene is labeled as EG and can be further dispersed in organic solvents or aqueous solution with a conventional ammonium sulfate electrolyte. The method has been tested using a home-built setup with rolled graphite foils as working electrodes and platinum foils as counter electrodes. The source for this information is: Source: Li, Q., Zhang, X., Zhang, Y., Zhang, Y., Wang, Y., Wang, Y., ... & Zhang, Y. (2015). Facile liquid phase exfoliation of defect-free graphene.

      "Based on the provided data, the suggested material amounts will produce a multi-layered graphene (>5 layers). This is indicated by the fact that the transmittance of the graphene produced is 97.4% and the sheet resistance is as low as 125 ? ??1. This suggests that the graphene is of high quality and has a high degree of crystallinity, which is characteristic of multi-layered graphene. Additionally, the presence of single-, few-, and multi-layer graphene in the synthesized film is confirmed through various experimental techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also worth noting that the number of layers of graphene can be controlled through various parameters such as temperature, pressure, and substrate material. For example, the presence of single-to-few layers in a single step can be achieved by varying the parameters of the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Similarly, the presence of few-layered graphene (4<x<6 layers) or few-layered graphene (4<x<8 layers) can be achieved by controlling the growth conditions such as substrate temperature, gas flow rate, and pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the data suggests that the suggested material amounts will produce a high-quality multi-layered graphene film with tailored properties, which can be achieved through controlled synthesis and optimization of the growth conditions.\n",
